# Responsible Artificial Intelligence (RAI) Measures Dataset

Currently, this work is on Version 1.0 of the publicly shared dataset and corresponding visualization. The dataset is in a Microsoft Excel (.xslx) format. Note that it is not recommended to open the file in a .csv format due to the increased likelihood of corrupted characters and file formatting. Please read the below sections for more information on the dataset.

## Using the Dataset
The spreadsheet includes user guidance stages grouping fifteen columns. These user guidance stages intentionally divide and describe the data columns among similarities that they share. The interactive Sunburst visualization can be found here: **https://rai-measures-dataset.onrender.com**. 

**Target Output (Columns A and B in Blue)**: The resulting measures collected in this dataset.
  1. Measure
  2. Measurement Process
     
**Entry Points (Columns C and D in Orange)**: The primary features in narrowing down potential measures for an algorithmic system.

  4. Principle
  5. Part of the ML System

**Measurement Properties (Columns E - G in Green)**: The standard(s) per which each measure uses in its evaluation.

  7. Criterion Name 
  8. Criterion Description 
  9. Type of Assessment

**Algorithmic System Characteristics (Columns H - K in Purple)**: Additional features that a user can consider when narrowing down measures to use.

  10. Application Area
  11. Purpose of ML System 
  12. Type of Data
  13. Algorithm Type

**Metadata (Columns L - O in Light Blue)**: Details further documentation into each source that was extracted to collect each feature and measure.

  14. Title
  15. Lead Author(s)
  16. Publication Year
  17. Key Contributions 

## Using the Interactive Visualization
This dataset has a corresponding visualization that can be dynamically interacted with. It can be found as the "Sunburst_Visualization_Link.md" file in this repository.
